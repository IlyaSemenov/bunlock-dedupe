## Usage

Run in any directory with a `bun.lock` file:

```bash
bunx bunlock-dedupe            # show all duplicates
bunx bunlock-dedupe --fixable  # show only fixable duplicates
bunx bunlock-dedupe --fix      # rewrite the lockfile
```

Or pass a path to a lockfile or project directory:

```bash
bunx bunlock-dedupe /path/to/bun.lock
bunx bunlock-dedupe /path/to/bun.lock --fixable
bunx bunlock-dedupe /path/to/bun.lock --fix
```

## What each mode does

**No flags** — scans the lockfile and lists every package that appears in more than one version. For each, it shows the package name, the versions found, and the full dependency path that pulled in each version (so you can see which package required what).

**`--fixable`** — same scan, but only shows packages where deduplication is actually possible. Marks the version that would be kept (`✅`) and the versions that can be upgraded to it (`⬆️`).

**`--fix`** — rewrites the lockfile, upgrading every dedupe-compatible version to the highest version that all their semver ranges allow.

## Output explained

Each duplicate package is listed with its versions. Here is what every status means:

```text
typescript
  ✅ 5.8.3
    - myapp: ^5.8.0
  ⬆️ 5.6.2 → 5.8.3
    - myapp > ts-jest: ^5.6.0

react
  ✅ 19.1.0
    - myapp: ^19.0.0
  ❌ 18.3.1
    - myapp > react-pdf: ^18.0.0

@types/node
  ✅ 22.13.0
    - myapp: ^22.0.0
  ⬆️ 20.18.0 → 22.13.0
    - myapp > bun-types: *

undici-types
  ✅ 7.16.0
    - myapp > @types/node: ~7.16.0
  🗑️ 5.28.5
    - myapp > bun-types > @types/node ⬆️: ~5.26.0
```

| Icon | Meaning |
| ---- | ------- |
| ✅ | **Target** — the version that will be kept |
| ⬆️ | **Can dedupe** — can be upgraded to the target; `--fix` will do this automatically |
| ❌ | **Cannot dedupe** — requires a version incompatible with the target; needs manual resolution |
| 🗑️ | **Orphan** — will become unreachable once its parent (marked ⬆️ in the path) is deduped; no action needed |
| ❓ | **Unknown** — uses a non-semver range (e.g. `catalog:`, `workspace:`) that cannot be checked automatically |

## How deduplication works

Bun sometimes resolves the same package at multiple versions because different packages declare different version ranges — even ranges that could be satisfied by the same version.

For example, if package A requires `^3.15.2` and package B requires `^3.17.0`, both ranges are compatible with `3.17.0`. `--fix` upgrades the `^3.15.2` entry to `3.17.0`, removing the duplicate.
